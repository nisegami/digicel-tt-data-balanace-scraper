# Digicel TT Data Balance Scraper

Scrape Digicel TT's web portal for your data balance. Store the result in a SQLite database and generate an "API file" to throw into your webroot folder to act as a quasi-API.

No GUI. It requires raw account credentials. Don't actually use this.

Made with:

- Typer
- Selenium
- PyVirtualDisplay + xvnc|xvfb
- SQLite3
